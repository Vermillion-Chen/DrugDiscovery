# Read RX


Our project, ReadRx, is a web-application that uses computer vision to transcribe text and then natural language processing to create user profiles to manage prescriptions. We also tackled accessibility issues by integrating translation applications and text-to-speech. If any of that sounds interesting, feel free to check out our Devpost!
